<h1>Note Recognition</h1>
<p>The perfect way to improve your note recognition!</p>
<p>When you press start, a note will play. After the note plays, click the correct note name. If you don't get it correct, you can keep trying until you do!</p>
<p>There are two different modes: <b>Vocal Match</b> and <b>Name That Note</b>.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Vocal Match</b> will play a note and ask you to sing it back.</li>
		<li><b>Name That Note</b> will play a note and ask you to identify which note it is.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Keep practicing with more notes to really build your ear training skills. <a href="/login">Log in</a> to save your progress!</p>
